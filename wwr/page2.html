            <h2>Rivers</h2>
            <p>
              This page is to give information about the rivers that the company
              runs.
            </p>
            <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h3>
            <p>
              Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
              Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
              River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
              number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
              rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
            </p>
            <p>
              Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and
              bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor
              is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the
              sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain
              when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon
              is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a
              free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
              early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There
              are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to
              swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.
            </p>
            <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h3>
            <p>
              Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most
              desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty
              Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
              scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile
              trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green
              River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic
              formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and
              great whitewater opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
            </p>
            <p>
              Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.&nbsp; This
              designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the
              canyon tells.
            </p>
            <h3>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>
            <p>
              This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
              river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
              breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river
              experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
              whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
              accessible only by river.
            </p>
            <p>
              CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The
              rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to
              accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
              However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river
              rating scale, so we often refer to both.

            <p>This is a place to answer frequently asked client questions.</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>
                Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?
              </dt>
              <dd>
                Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have
                found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it
                more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their
                children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is
                that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a
                time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any
                age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most
                beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see
                around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things
                <em>very</em> interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a
                guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for
                very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even
                true!
              </dd>
              <dt>
                Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I
                still come?
              </dt>
              <dd>
                As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
                element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
                certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
                years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns
                and injuries that occur on land. <br>
                Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved
                life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go
                on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you
                an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins
                explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that
                you fall out of the raft.
              </dd>
              <dt>What is included in the trip?</dt>
              <dd>
                We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a
                sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof
                day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. <br>
                We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot
                chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You
                may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2
                cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night
                before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day,
                plus snacks
              </dd>
              <dt>What do I need to bring?</dt>
              <dd>
                The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes
                in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot &amp; dry and cold &amp; wet
                Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos Quick dry shirts
                and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you
                cooler on hot days. Button down shirts provide more sun protection
                on the neck Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong the
                best thing for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts if you are
                cold natured, bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom
                Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a
                base layer during the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of
                quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if
                you are cold, cotton if you are hot). Two piece swim suits are
                convenient when changing or going to the bathroom. hat- large brim
                hat offers protection from the sun with a good quality strap.
                Sunglasses with strap socks- used for hiking and to protect your
                feet from the sun. sandals or water shoes- if not used to hiking
                in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before camper

              <dt>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</dt>
              <dd>
                Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater
                rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river. <br>
                Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent
                sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm
                breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then
                pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with
                some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history,
                geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4
                or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or
                good company by the river, or explore around camp while your
                guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and
                potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't
                forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing,
                and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story
                or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought
                were possible.
              </dd>
              <dt>How far in advance should I book my trip?</dt>
              <dd>
                If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year
                in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is
                usually sufficient.

            <h3>Highlights from the past season</h3>
    
            <p>
              What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year
              of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips
              down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our
              favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them
              to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather in
              the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every
              minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared
              reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We
              didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those
              temperatures.

            <h3>Encounters in the wild!</h3>
            <p>
              Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United
              States. We share these areas with lots of critters both large and
              small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself
              face to face with one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of
              them being harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that can
              be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found in
              almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment.
              The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is
              the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do not
              worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and
              luckily humans are not on that list!
            </p>
            <p>
              They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will
              eat crickets, moths, spiders and other insects. Many compare their
              sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with ice, aspirin
              and time.
            </p>
            <p>
              When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night.
              Always wear your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to
              see where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion and if you
              get stung, see your guide immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged
              mountain west. It is one of two species of wild sheep in North
              America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur.
              Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and
              smell that helps them detect and avoid predators.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have
              horns but they are short with a slight curvature. Horns are used as
              tools for eating and fighting.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park
              service asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game animals.
              Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.

              If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park
              service asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game animals.
              Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.
