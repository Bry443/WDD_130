        [Introduction: If you are new to Minecraft, and want to get better at it, this site is perfect for you! A simple way to get better at Minecraft is to learn about your armors. Armor can be defined by 3 main traits: type, defense points, and durability. Now, there are special modifiers for some armors, (such as Armor toughness), but for now I’ll describe the main three: Type is the material that the armor is made from. It is important to know where your armor comes from so that you know what armor to make. The defense points of an armor define how much damage is negated during attacks. The higher your armor rating, the less damage that you will take. And lastly, durability defines how much damage your equipment can take before it completely breaks. Each of these details are exceptionally important to know when you are looking for armor to wear. Knowing your armor helps you weigh the positives and negatives of achieving different types of armor. It is important to know the materials required to craft an armor so that you can utilize the materials you’ve currently gathered at the time.
        Leather armor is made from leather, Iron armor is made from iron, and so one. The exections to this format are the shields, turtle shells, chainmail, and netherite.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        [Page 2: The specific types of armor:
        Every armor set is listed here: Leather armor, chainmail armor, gold armor, iron armor, diamond armor, and netherite armor. There is also some special armors that are notable to mention which are: the turtle shell helmet, the shield, and the elytra. Now, the elytra’s main function is not to be used as armor, but it does function as a wearable item. 
        Defense points: 
        Elytra: 0.
        Shield: 0.
        Turtle Shell: 2.
        Leather cap: 1, Leather Tunic: 3, Leather pants 2, Leather boots 1.
        Golden Helmet: 2, Golden Chestplate: 5, Golden Leggings 3, Golden boots: 1.
        Chainmail Helmet: 2, Chainmail Chestplate: 5, Chainmail Leggings: 3, Chainmail boots: 1.
        Iron Helmet: 2, Iron Chestplate: 6, Iron Leggings: 5, Iron boots: 2.
        Diamond Helmet: 3, Diamond Chestplate: 8, Diamond Leggings: 6, Diamond Boots: 3.
        Netherite Helmet: 3, Netherite Chestplate: 8, Netherite Leggings: 6, Netherite Boots: 3.
        The durability of equipment should definitely be taken into consideration as this defines how long you can use it during combat. The listing I offered of Leather, gold, chainmail, iron, diamond, and netherite measure from least durability rating to the highest durability rating at full netherite armor.
        Durability:
        Elytra: 432.
        Shield: 336.
        Turtle Shell: 275.
        Leather cap: 55, Leather Tunic: 80, Leather pants 74, Leather boots 65.
        Golden Helmet: 77, Golden Chestplate: 112, Golden Leggings 105, Golden boots: 91.
        Chainmail Helmet: 165, Chainmail Chestplate: 240, Chainmail Leggings: 225, Chainmail boots: 195.
        Iron Helmet: 165, Iron Chestplate: 240, Iron Leggings: 225, Iron boots: 195.
        Diamond Helmet: 363, Diamond Chestplate: 528, Diamond Leggings: 495, Diamond Boots: 429.
        Netherite Helmet: 407, Netherite Chestplate: 592, Netherite Leggings: 555, Netherite Boots: 481.

        [Contact/ about me:
        I’ve always wanted to make a simple and quick guide for a game and thus this site was born. The difference between this site and some other wiki-guide is that this one offers a simple layout of details whereas the wiki usually bombards the reader with too many details that they frankly have no use for.
        About me: I am an aspiring computer science major, and I want to excel in my current studies. I’m currently attending school at Brigham Young University Idaho. 
        Don’t be afraid if you would like to shoot me an email at bkt443@gmail.com for questions, comments, and concerns about this site or it’s details. If you find any incorrect details or conflicting updates, just tell me and I’ll try my best to fix it.
