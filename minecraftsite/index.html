                Introduction: If you are new to Minecraft, and want to get better at it, this site is perfect for you!
                A simple way to get better at Minecraft is to learn about your armors. 
                Armor can be defined by 3 main traits: type, defense points, and durability. 
                Now, there are special modifiers for some armors, (such as Armor toughness), 
                but for now I’ll describe the main three: Type is the material that the armor is made from. 
                It is important to know where your armor comes from so that you know what armor to make. 
                e defense points of an armor define how much damage is negated during attacks. 
                The higher your armor rating, the less damage that you will take. 
                And lastly, durability defines how much damage your equipment can take before it completely breaks. 
                Each of these details are exceptionally important to know when you are looking for armor to wear. 
                Knowing your armor helps you weigh the positives and negatives of achieving different types of armor. 
                It is important to know the materials required to craft an armor so that you can utilize the materials you’ve currently gathered at the time.
                Leather armor is made from leather, Iron armor is made from iron, and so one. 
                The exections to this format are the shields, turtle shells, chainmail, and netherite.
